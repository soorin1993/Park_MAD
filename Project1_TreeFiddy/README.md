5. App Funcionality: Users can add one of three categories (income, bills, expenses) to the table view where they will be organized per category. Each item will need a type, amount, and frequency to be successfully added to the table. Once added to the table, app will caculate the income and expenses and subtract the expenses from income for a total amount.
